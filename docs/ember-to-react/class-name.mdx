# Class name

Ember uses `class`, while React uses `className` for defining CSS classes. CSS classes are used for associating styles with elements. Libraries like Material use classes to define icons, as seen in code examples.

## Ember 

The `class` attribute is used to define static CSS classes directly in the Handlebars template.

```hbs
<i class='mdi mdi-18px mdi-close-circle' />
```

## React

`className` is used instead of `class` to define CSS classes. This is because `class` is a [reserved word](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#reserved_words) in JavaScript so JSX has to avoid it for transpilation [more info](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525#issuecomment-417818906). 


```jsx
<i className='mdi mdi-18px mdi-close-circle' />
```
