# Fragment

Fragments represent smaller, reusable parts of a user interface within an application.

## Ember 

In Ember, you can return multiple elements naturally because Ember templates allow this without the explicit need for a wrapper component.

```hbs
Text outside
<p>Text inside</p>
```

## React 

React components can only return one root node ([doc](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment)). A Fragment is a lightweight wrapper that lets you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is particularly useful when a component needs to return multiple sibling elements.


```jsx live
function TextContainer() {
  return (
    <>
      Text outside
      <p>Text inside</p>
    </>
  )
}
```
