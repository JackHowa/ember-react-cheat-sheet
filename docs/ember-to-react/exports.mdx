# Exports

In React when exporting a component, we must use default exports vs named exports.

## Ember

In ember we already use default exports:
```js title="component.js" showLineNumbers
export default class OrganizationSelector extends Component {}
```

```hbs title="template.hbs"  showLineNumbers
 <OrganizationSelector />
```

## React

This means doing something like this when importing/exporting:

Import:
```jsx 
import organizationSelector from './organizationSelector';
```

Export:
```jsx 
export default organizationSelector;
```

**Do not do the below**:

Import:
```jsx 
import { organizationSelector } from './organizationSelector';
```

Export:
```jsx 
export { organizationSelector };
```
