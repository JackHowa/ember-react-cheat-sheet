# Children 

Managing children is a core concept that allows developers to compose flexible and reusable components. "Children" generally refer to the content or other components nested inside a parent component. Composability empowers developers to build modular interfaces.

## Ember 

`{{yield}}` is used to render the content passed to a component from its parent ([doc](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.24.0/components/block-content/)).

```hbs title="/components/bolded-project-name.hbs"
<b>
  Ember to React cheat sheet
</b>
```

```hbs title="/components/greeting.hbs"
<p>
  Hello {{yield}}!!!
</p>
```

## React

`children` is accessed from `props` to render nested content within a component ([doc](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children)). Child components must be imported in React.

```jsx live noInline
const BoldedProjectName = () => <b>Ember to React cheat sheet</b>

const Greeting = (props) => {
  const { children } = props;
  return (
    <p>Hello {children}!!!</p>
  )
}

render(
  <Greeting>
    <BoldedProjectName />
  </Greeting>
);
```
